This folder is for custom SASS files (Simply Awesome Style Sheets) for Learning Management System

The base folder corresponding to this folder is:

/edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/lms/static/sass/


## Notes

- The most important elements of the theme come from the 
  file /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/themes/red-theme/lms/static/sass/partials/lms/theme/_variables.scss. 
  This file actually originates from Bootstrap and is used exclusively for overriding Bootstrap theme variables.
- _variable.scss is intended to be used to override any of the dozens of variables assigned 
  in /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/lms/static/sass/partials/lms/theme/_variables-v1.scss.
